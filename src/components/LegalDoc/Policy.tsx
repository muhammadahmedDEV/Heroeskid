            our Site. Cookies make using the Internet easier by, among other
            things, saving your preferences for you. For example, a cookie lets
            the Site remember that you’ve registered, which allows us to speed
            up your future activities at our Site, and which allows you to enter
            your registration information less frequently while visiting our
            Site. We may also use cookies to deliver content tailored to your
            interests. Our cookies may enable us to relate your use of our Site
            to personally identifying information that you previously submitted,
            such as calling you by name when you return to our Site. If your
            browser is set to reject cookies, or if your browser notifies you
            that you are about to receive a cookie and you reject it, then your
